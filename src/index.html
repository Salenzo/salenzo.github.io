        <br></br>
        <p>The free software movement is committed to enabling computer users to obtain freedom through free
            software.
            Users
            of
            free software can autonomously control their calculations. Non-free software subjects users to
            software
            developers. See
            the video introduction.</p>

        <h2>What is free software?</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>Free software means that users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, research, modify and
            improve the
            software.

        <p>Free software is a matter of rights, not price. To understand this concept, you should consider
            "free" as the
            "freedom"
            in "free speech"; not the "free" in "free beer".</p>

        <p>More precisely, free software grants software users four basic freedoms:</p>

        <p>Regardless of the purpose, there is freedom to run the software (freedom zero).
            There is the freedom to study how the software works and rewrite the software as needed (free one).
            Obtaining
            the source
            code of the software is mentioned before achieving this purpose.</p>
        <p>There is the freedom to redistribute the copy so that you can use it to get close to neighbors
            (Freedom 2).
            There is the freedom to release an improved version of the software to the public (Freedom 3) so
            that the
            entire
            community can benefit from it. Obtaining the source code of the software is mentioned before
            achieving this
            purpose.</p>

        <p>Compared with 1983, the development of technology and network makes these freedoms more important
            now.</p>

        <p>Now the free software movement is much more than the development of the GNU system. See the Free
            Software
            Foundation
            website to learn more about what we do and how you can participate.
