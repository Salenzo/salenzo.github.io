# What is Ŝalenzo?

Ŝalenzo is a free software development organization—that is, it respects the freedom of its users. The Ŝalenzo system includes the Ŝalenzo software package (a program exclusively released by the Ŝalenzo project) and free software released by third parties. Ŝalenzo was developed to allow you to use your computer freely and efficiently without installing software that might infringe your freedom.

We recommend installing these Ŝalenzo versions, they are completely free software.
